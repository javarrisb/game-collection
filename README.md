# Game-Collection

## User Story

As a board game fanatic
I would like a place to manage my collection
So that I can see my games and adds comments about them

- should we have a homepage? What should users see when they are not logged in?
    ? show lists and the users who created them?
    ? allow non logged in users to see the games (and comments on those games) in the lists?
-Dashboard - when logged in: Shows users lists
    * Button to create a new list
    * When user clicks on list it shows all the games in the list
    * When user clicks on the game (shows comments and ability to add comments)(could call boardgamegeek* api to get data about game)

items in () are additions if we have time
